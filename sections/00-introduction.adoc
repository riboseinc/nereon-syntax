== Introduction

The Nereon project aims to unify and glue together cloud
configuration management through the Nereon data models.

The Nereon Object Configuration syntax (NOC) and Nereon Object Configuration Schema syntax (NOS)
are methods used to express configuration settings in
Nereon data models, and can also be used as interchangeable
files.

Nereon is a play on Nereus, the shapeshifting sea god of the Greeks, the eldest son of Pontus and Gaia. "`Nereon`" literally means "`place of Nereus`", representing the shape-shifting nature of configuration.
